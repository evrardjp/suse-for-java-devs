## Welcome to SUSE for java devs

### Goals

The goal of this project is to contain recipes for developing with Java, regardless of the Operating System where you come from, on SUSE based distributions.

### Where is the website content?

In the gh-pages branch.

### How to contribute

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/evrardjp/suse-for-java-devs/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

You can also fork/clone/edit, and send a github pull request.
