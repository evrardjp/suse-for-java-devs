# Welcome to SUSE for java devs!

## Philosophy

The \*SUSE way is to avoid vendor lock-in, and leverage freely available standards where possible.

This repository is following the same guidelines, and you will basically see how to migrate from your proprietary systems, towards freely available solutions based on standards.

The git repo will contain tools to build your own environments on SUSE based distros.

## Disclaimer

SUSE SLES product supports tomcat. If you only need tomcat, you might not need to check further, and just use SLES.

This repository takes a different approach: "What can we build together, as a community (and therefore not supported by SUSE), to have a different kind of working JAVA environments on \*SUSE based distros?".

This repository should also resolve the pain points of migrating from proprietary systems towards open, freely available ones.

## Repository contents

* Docs and learning experiences
* Migration tooling from * towards tomEE (tomcat + JakartaEE)
* How to build your own packages/containers with intermediary solutions, which might be helping on the migration (Wildfly).
